# Getting Started

## Installation

```bash
$ composer require friendsofcxml/cxml-php
```

Then include Composerâ€™s autoloader:

```php
require_once 'vendor/autoload.php';
```

## Get current dtd definition files

1. Download get current Specification from http://cxml.org/downloads.html
2. Extract files
3. Use cXML.dtd for validation (see below)

## Quickstart

### Identity and credentials

```php
//we use a basic registry here. You could use your own (db-based?) repository that implements CredentialRepositoryInterface
$credentialRegistry = new \CXml\Credential\Registry();

$someSupplier = new \CXml\Model\Credential('DUNS', 12345);
$credentialRegistry->registerCredential($someSupplier);

$someBuyer = new \CXml\Model\Credential('my-id-type', "buyer@domain.com");
$credentialRegistry->registerCredential($someBuyer);

$someHub = new \CXml\Model\Credential('my-id-type', "hub@domain.com", "abracadabra");
$credentialRegistry->registerCredential($someHub);
```

### Register Handler

```php
$handlerRegistry = new \CXml\Handler\HandlerRegistry();

$handlerRegistry->register(new CXml\Handler\Request\SelfAwareProfileRequestHandler(...));
$handlerRegistry->register(new CXml\Handler\Request\StaticStartPagePunchOutSetupRequestHandler(...));
$handlerRegistry->register(new MyOrderRequestHandler());
$handlerRegistry->register(new MyStatusUpdateRequestHandler());
...
```

### Build cXML

```php
//$payload = new \CXml\Model\Message\...Message(...);
//or...
//$payload = new \CXml\Model\Request\...Request(...);
//or...
$payload = new \CXml\Model\Response\...Response(...);

$cXml = \CXml\Builder::create()
    ->payload($payload)
    ->build();

$payload = new \CXml\Model\Request\...Request(...);
$cXml = \CXml\Builder::create()
    ->payload($payload)
    ->from(...)
    ->to(...)
    ->sender(...)
    ->build();
```

### Register outgoing cXML documents

You may want to register sent-out documents so they can be referenced by subsequent request-documents via payloadId.

```php
$documentRegistory = new MyDocumentRegistry(); //implements CXml\Document\DocumentRegistryInterface

$documentRegistory->register($cXml);
```

### Process incoming cXML documents

```php
$headerProcessor = new \CXml\Processor\HeaderProcessor($credentialRegistry, $credentialRegistry);

$cXmlProcessor = new \CXml\Processor\Processor(
  $headerProcessor, 
  $handlerRegistry,
  $builder
);

$cXmlProcessor->process($cXml);
```

### Putting it all together

```php
$credentialRegistry = new \CXml\Credential\Registry();
//TODO register...

$handlerRegistry = new \CXml\Handler\HandlerRegistry();
//TODO register...

$builder = \CXml\Builder::create();

$headerProcessor = new \CXml\Processor\HeaderProcessor($credentialRegistry, $credentialRegistry);
$cXmlProcessor = new \CXml\Processor\Processor(
  $headerProcessor, 
  $handlerRegistry,
  $builder
);

$pathToDtd = '.'; //point the directory with extracted contents of zip-file with the DTDs, downloaded from cxml.org
$dtdValidator = \CXml\Validation\DtdValidator::fromDtdDirectory($pathToDtd);
$serializer = \CXml\Serializer::create();

$endpoint = new \CXml\Endpoint(
    $serializer,
    $dtdValidator,
    $cXmlProcessor
);

//$xmlString could be the body of an incoming http request
$xmlString = '<cXML>...</cXML>';
$result = $endpoint->parseAndProcessStringAsCXml($xmlString);

//$result could be null (i.e. for a Response or Message) or another CXml object which would be the Response to a Request
//you would have to handle the transport yourself
```

### Handling Date vs DateTime

The cXML specification is not perfectly clear about the format of dates and times. The specification says that dates 
should be formatted "in the restricted subset of ISO 8601". That means that the format could either be a full ISO 8601
format with time and timezone information (i.e. 2015-04-14T13:36:00-08:00) or a format without time and timezone
(2015-04-14).

With some fields the actual time of day is not relevant and could lead to confusion. For example, the 
`requestedDeliveryDate` field in `ItemOut`. Real-world experience shows that here it is common to only specify the date.
Althout one could argue that the time of day is still relevant here for real tight on-point deliveries.

To solve this problem we introduced a determined `CXml\Model\Date` class in case of using an explicit 
date (without time). This class extends `DateTime` and is therefore compatible with the rest of the model. The class
enforces a date-only representation (Y-m-d).

#### Serialization

You should use the `CXml\Model\Date` class when generating your object-graph in cases you want to output a date-only
value.

#### Deserialization

When parsing a date-property from a cXML document, the `CXml\Model\Date` will be instantiated **if** a date-only
value was discovered (Y-m-d).
