    Common to most variants of the PunchOut transaction set. Defined here
    to be easily shared between multiple DTD files without requiring
    inclusion of Transaction.mod in all of them.

    All of the PunchOut transaction sets include an originating Request
    (ProviderSetupRequest for example), relatively simple Response
    (PunchOutSetupResponse for example) and final Message
    (ProviderDoneMessage or PunchOutOrderMessage). The Request and
    Response comprise a back-end transaction between two cooperating
    applications that wish to extend an interactive session from one to the
    other. The Request provides the destination application with
    authentication, identification and other setup information. The
    Response provides the originating application with a unique starting
    location for the interactive (HTML) session at the destination system.

    After receiving a Response of this type, the originating application
    redirects the user's browser to the provided location. (For some
    non-HTML applications, opening a new browser window at that location
    may be more appropriate.) The destination system eventually provides
    an HTML form to the user's browser. This form submits the final
    Message to close the remote session, return that user to the
    originating application and carry any required information back to the
    originating application.

    @attr taxedElement An ID reference that uniquely identifies the item being taxed???

    @attr purpose The purpose of the tax, for example, tax (tax), custom duty, shippingTax,
       specialHandlingTax, and so on.

    @attr category The tax category, Sales tax (sales), Use tax (usage), VAT (vat),
       GST (gst) are defined categories. Other values are permitted.

    @attr percentageRate The tax rate in number of percentage.

    @attr isVatRecoverable Set to "yes" if the entire invoice is VAT (Value Added Tax)-recoverable. Default is false.

    @attr taxPointDate Refers to the date on which VAT becomes due.

    @attr paymentDate Indicates the date when payment must be made.

    @attr isTriangularTransaction Set to "yes" to indicate that the transaction occurred between 
		three parties in three different countries, but the movement of goods did not follow the 
		invoicing route. Add a Contract element with role="subsequentBuyer" to identify the 
		subsequent buying organization in triangular transactions.

    @attr exemptDetail If the TaxAmount is zero, VAT or other regulations may require
		a reason why. Possible values:
		<ul>
		<li>zeroRated - The tax rate is zero.</li>
		<li>exempt - The item or items are exempt from taxation.</li>
		</ul>
	   
	@attr isWithholdingTax Set to "yes" if the tax is a withholding tax. 
	   
    @attr taxRateType Specify the tax rate type code (a string) that corresponds to a specific tax type. 
 	   For example, in Germany the tax rate of 19\% for value-added tax (VAT) corresponds to the "Standard" tax rate type. 
 	   In different EU member states, different VAT rates are allowed.
	   
 	   The tax rate type makes it easy for the back-end system to handle different rates that result from changes in tax law.

		Brazil) TaxAmount is calculated considering the basePercentageRate along with percentageRate.
		%
		TaxAmount = TaxableAmount * percentageRate * basePercentageRate
		$

    SupplierBatch is the batch ID provided by the supplier at the line item quantity level

<!ELEMENT SupplierBatchID (#PCDATA)>


<!--
    How the supplier identifies an item they sell.

    If SupplierPartID does not provide a unique key to identify the item,
    then the supplier should generate a key which identifies the part
    uniquely when combined with the SupplierID and SupplierPartID. The
    key is called SupplierPartAuxiliaryID.


    An example is where a Supplier would use the same PartID for an
    item but have a different price for units of "EA" versus "BOX".
    In this case, the ItemIDs should be:
	%
    <ItemID>
        <SupplierPartID>pn12345</SupplierPartID>
        <SupplierPartAuxiliaryID>EA</SupplierPartAuxiliaryID>
    </ItemID>
    <ItemID>
        <SupplierPartID>pn12345</SupplierPartID>
        <SupplierPartAuxiliaryID>
           <foo>well formed XML here</foo>
        </SupplierPartAuxiliaryID>
    </ItemID>
	%
    In this case, the "foo" element must be defined in an internal subset
    sent with the cXML document. Otherwise, parsers will not be able to
    validate that document.

    In a preferred approach, the sending application may escape the contained
    XML using CDATA sections. This would appear as:
	%
       ...
       <SupplierPartAuxiliaryID>
           <![CDATA[<foo>well formed XML here</foo>]]>
       </SupplierPartAuxiliaryID>
       ...
	%
    Finally, the angle brackets could be escaped using XML character
    entities. This might be a bit harder for humans to read. For example:
	%
       ...
       <SupplierPartAuxiliaryID>
           &lt;foo&gt;well formed XML here&lt;/foo&gt;
       </SupplierPartAuxiliaryID>
       ...
	%
-->
<!ELEMENT SupplierPartID (#PCDATA)> <!-- string -->
<!-- 
    @attr revisionID Also known as Material Revision Level. "Revision" is the most widely-used
       term for referring to that attribute which distinguishes one closely-related design 
	   iteration from another. A revision represents a change to an object, or a modification 
	   to a part such that the part remains interchangeable with its previous iteration.
       As part of engineering change management the supplier uses the revision level to uniquely 
	   identify the version of a product, of an article or of a part. 
-->     
<!ATTLIST SupplierPartID
	revisionID	%string;	#IMPLIED
>

<!--
	If SupplierPartID does not uniquely identify the item, the supplier should use SupplierPartAuxiliaryID to specify an "auxiliary" 
	key that identifies the part uniquely when combined with the SupplierID and SupplierPartID. For example, a supplier might use 
	the same SupplierPartID for an item, but have a different price for units of "EA" and "BOX". In this case, a reasonable 
	SupplierPartAuxiliaryID for the two items might be "EA" and "BOX."
	
	SupplierPartAuxiliaryID could also be used as a supplier cookie, enabling the supplier to refer to complex configuration or 
	part data. It could contain all the data necessary for the supplier to reconstruct what the item in question is in their 
	computer system (a basket or cookie of data that makes sense only to the supplier).
	
	SupplierPartAuxiliaryID can help a remote website transport complex configuration or bill-of-goods information to re-identify 
	the item when it is presented to the remote website in the future.
	
	If SupplierPartAuxiliaryID contains special characters (for example, if it contains additional XML elements not defined in the 
	cXML protocol), they must be escaped properly. Due to the necessity to pass SupplierPartAuxiliaryID information through 
	applications and back to the originating supplier, an internal subset containing any additional XML elements is insufficient.

<!--
    Header of an order. This is the data that is sent to the supplier

    Total: If the Order is of type "blanket", the Total element is not used to compute
		the sum of the item level subtotals. The total is used to indicate the maximum
		commitment with the supplier. The total will not add up to the individual item
		level sub total or MaxAmounts. The item level MaxAmounts should not exceed the
		header level total. If the item level MaxAmount is not specified it is assumed
		that the Item level maximum amount is the same as the Total.

		the company code and purchasing organization, respectively.
	
    DeliveryPeriod: Start and end date for the delivery.
     	
    IdReference: ID reference is Within the application context (for example,
		a certain pair of buyer and supplier), the (identifier, domain) pair 
		should be unique.
 
	OrderRequestHeaderIndustry: Industry specific header information.

    DocumentReference: Only needed when the type is "update" or "delete". In that case, 
		the DocumentReference would reference the most recent OrderRequest document
		for the order. For example when an order is created, updated and then
		deleted, the final document should contain a DocumentReference
		referring to the OrderRequest with type="update". That document would,

<!ELEMENT ContractRequest (ContractRequestHeader, ContractItemIn+)>

<!--
    Header of a Contract. This is the header level information in the Contract.

    LegalEntity: Legal entity defined in the external system. Smallest organizational unit of external accounting for which a complete,
        self-contained set of accounts can be created. This includes the entry of all transactions that must be posted and
        the creation of all items for legal individual financial statements, such as the balance sheet and the profit and loss statement.
        For example, Company Code for SAP.

    OrganizationalUnit: Purchase Unit or Purchase group defined in the external system.
        Purchase Unit is an organizational unit within Logistics. Almost all business transactions related to
        procurement are carried out in a purchase unit.
        A purchasing group corresponds to a buyer or group of buyers who perform the following
        purchasing activities:
		<ul>
		<li>Procuring certain articles or merchandise categories</li>
		<li>Acting as the contact for vendors</li>
		</ul>
        For example, Purchasing Organization or Purchasing Group.
			%
            <OrganizationalUnit domain="PurchasingOrganization">
                 1001
            </OrganizationalUnit>
            <OrganizationalUnit domain="PurchasingGroup">
                 10101
            </OrganizationalUnit>
			%
    DocumentInfo: Contract Id managed in the external system. This would be sent for "update" operation.
        For example,
		%
        <DocumentInfo documentID="55000000" documentType="Contract"/>
		%

    ParentContractInfo: Parent contract Id if the current contract is a part of an hierarchy.

    FollowUpDocument: This would give a hint to the ERP system that the next step should be to create "value" Contract or "quantity" contract etc.
        Example 1: 
		%
		<FollowUpDocument type="value" category="Contract"/>
		%
        Example 2: 
		%
		<FollowUpDocument type="LP" category="Scheduling Agreement"/>
		%

    QuoteRequestReference: If the contract is referencing to QuoteRequest originated from the external system, send requestId and requestDate.

    TermsOfDelivery: Optional shipping terms (incoTerms) as defined by the International Chamber of
        Commerce. These terms inform the buyer which portion of the shipping charges are their responsibility.
        For example,
		%
        <TermsOfDelivery>
            <TermsOfDeliveryCode value="TransportCondition"/>
            <ShippingPaymentMethod value ="Other"/>
            <TransportTerms value="FOB">Free on board vessel</TransportTerms>
        </TermsOfDelivery>

    The representation of a contract line item to be sent to external system.

    TermsOfDelivery: Optional item level incoTerms.

    ReferenceDocumentInfo: Optional reference document info for this line item.
        For example, Requisition or RFQ in the external system.
		%
        <ReferenceDocumentInfo lineNumber = "1">
            <DocumentInfo documentID = "RFQ12345"

        </ReferenceDocumentInfo>
		%
        The lineNumber attribute in the <ItemIn> will be used to specify the corresponding
        lineNumber on the contract in the source buyer system.
        At an implementation, level checks should be made to validate this.

        itemClassification attribute in the <ItemIn> will be used to specify whether the current line item is material or service.

        The external system Id of PaymentTerm can be sent as an extrinsic inside of <PaymentTerm>
        For example,
		%
        <PaymentTerm payInNumberOfDays="30">
			<Extrinsic name="Id">Net30</Extrinsic>
        </PaymentTerm>
		%
        Address in ShipTo will be used specify Location (Plant or StorageLocation for SAP) of the line item.
        For example,
		% 
        <ShipTo>
			<Address
				addressID="3000"
				addressIDDomain="buyerLocationID"
				isoCountryCode="US">
				<Name xml:lang="en">Plant 3000</Name>
			</Address>
        </ShipTo>
		%

        <IdReference> in <ItemID> will be used to send the corresponding line number of the
        contract in the external system. For example, domain = "SAPLineNumber", identifier="0100"

        The quantity attribute in the ItemIn tag should be set to target quantity. If the line item is amount based,
        it could be set to one.

        The UnitsOfMeasure of Min/MaxQuantity and Min/MaxReleaseQuantity is same as the one in ItemDetail.

        The MaxReleaseAmount/Quantity and MinReleaseAmount/Quantity at an item level
        indicate the item level amounts and quantities per release (purchase order).

        <Modifications> in <UnitPrice> will be used to send Discount amount/percent, Surcharges, Tax, etc.
        For example,
		%
        <UnitPrice>
            <Money currency="USD">1000.00</Money>
            <Modifications>
                 <Modification>

    A Credential Message Authentication Code (MAC). This is used in

    party trusted by both.

    The MAC should be computed by the trusted third party and
    transferred to the sender. The MAC should be opaque to the sender
    (that is, it should be secure and non-reversible). The MAC should
    use as its inputs enough information to accomplish the following
    goals:

    (1) The MAC must prove to the receiver that it really originated
    with the trusted third party. For example, the MAC could use a shared
    secret between the receiver and the trusted third party as its
    secret key.

    (2) The MAC should be usable only by a certain sender. For example, the
    MAC could authenticate an identifier for the sending organization.

    (3) The MAC should prove that the sender is authorized to send on
    behalf of the From organization. For example, the MAC could authenticate
    an identifier for the From organization.

    (4) The MAC should limit the risk of the MAC being compromised and
    used to impersonate the sender by another party communicating with
    the receiver. For example, the MAC could authenticate an expiration date
