    Common to most variants of the PunchOut transaction set. Defined here
    to be easily shared between multiple DTD files without requiring
    inclusion of Transaction.mod in all of them.

    All of the PunchOut transaction sets include an originating Request
    (ProviderSetupRequest for example), relatively simple Response
    (PunchOutSetupResponse for example) and final Message
    (ProviderDoneMessage or PunchOutOrderMessage). The Request and
    Response comprise a back-end transaction between two cooperating
    applications that wish to extend an interactive session from one to the
    other. The Request provides the destination application with
    authentication, identification and other setup information. The
    Response provides the originating application with a unique starting
    location for the interactive (HTML) session at the destination system.

    After receiving a Response of this type, the originating application
    redirects the user's browser to the provided location. (For some
    non-HTML applications, opening a new browser window at that location
    may be more appropriate.) The destination system eventually provides
    an HTML form to the user's browser. This form submits the final
    Message to close the remote session, return that user to the
    originating application and carry any required information back to the
    originating application.

    @attr taxedElement An ID reference that uniquely identifies the item being taxed???

    @attr purpose The purpose of the tax, for example, tax (tax), custom duty, shippingTax,
       specialHandlingTax, and so on.

    @attr category The tax category, Sales tax (sales), Use tax (usage), VAT (vat),
       GST (gst) are defined categories. Other values are permitted.

    @attr percentageRate The tax rate in number of percentage.

    @attr isVatRecoverable Set to "yes" if the entire invoice is VAT (Value Added Tax)-recoverable. Default is false.

    @attr taxPointDate Refers to the date on which VAT becomes due.

    @attr paymentDate Indicates the date when payment must be made.

    @attr isTriangularTransaction Set to "yes" to indicate that the transaction occurred between 
		three parties in three different countries, but the movement of goods did not follow the 
		invoicing route. Add a Contract element with role="subsequentBuyer" to identify the 
		subsequent buying organization in triangular transactions.

    @attr exemptDetail If the TaxAmount is zero, VAT or other regulations may require
		a reason why. Possible values:
		<ul>
		<li>zeroRated - The tax rate is zero.</li>
		<li>exempt - The item or items are exempt from taxation.</li>
		</ul>
	   
	@attr isWithholdingTax Set to "yes" if the tax is a withholding tax. 
	   
    @attr taxRateType Specify the tax rate type code (a string) that corresponds to a specific tax type. 
 	   For example, in Germany the tax rate of 19\% for value-added tax (VAT) corresponds to the "Standard" tax rate type. 
 	   In different EU member states, different VAT rates are allowed.
	   
 	   The tax rate type makes it easy for the back-end system to handle different rates that result from changes in tax law.

		Brazil) TaxAmount is calculated considering the basePercentageRate along with percentageRate.
		%
		TaxAmount = TaxableAmount * percentageRate * basePercentageRate
		$

    SupplierBatch is the batch ID provided by the supplier at the line item quantity level

<!ELEMENT SupplierBatchID (#PCDATA)>


<!--
    How the supplier identifies an item they sell.

    If SupplierPartID does not provide a unique key to identify the item,
    then the supplier should generate a key which identifies the part
    uniquely when combined with the SupplierID and SupplierPartID. The
    key is called SupplierPartAuxiliaryID.


    An example is where a Supplier would use the same PartID for an
    item but have a different price for units of "EA" versus "BOX".
    In this case, the ItemIDs should be:
	%
    <ItemID>
        <SupplierPartID>pn12345</SupplierPartID>
        <SupplierPartAuxiliaryID>EA</SupplierPartAuxiliaryID>
    </ItemID>
    <ItemID>
        <SupplierPartID>pn12345</SupplierPartID>
        <SupplierPartAuxiliaryID>
           <foo>well formed XML here</foo>
        </SupplierPartAuxiliaryID>
    </ItemID>
	%
    In this case, the "foo" element must be defined in an internal subset
    sent with the cXML document. Otherwise, parsers will not be able to
    validate that document.

    In a preferred approach, the sending application may escape the contained
    XML using CDATA sections. This would appear as:
	%
       ...
       <SupplierPartAuxiliaryID>
           <![CDATA[<foo>well formed XML here</foo>]]>
       </SupplierPartAuxiliaryID>
       ...
	%
    Finally, the angle brackets could be escaped using XML character
    entities. This might be a bit harder for humans to read. For example:
	%
       ...
       <SupplierPartAuxiliaryID>
           &lt;foo&gt;well formed XML here&lt;/foo&gt;
       </SupplierPartAuxiliaryID>
       ...
	%
-->
<!ELEMENT SupplierPartID (#PCDATA)> <!-- string -->
<!-- 
    @attr revisionID Also known as Material Revision Level. "Revision" is the most widely-used
       term for referring to that attribute which distinguishes one closely-related design 
	   iteration from another. A revision represents a change to an object, or a modification 
	   to a part such that the part remains interchangeable with its previous iteration.
       As part of engineering change management the supplier uses the revision level to uniquely 
	   identify the version of a product, of an article or of a part. 
-->     
<!ATTLIST SupplierPartID
	revisionID	%string;	#IMPLIED
>

<!--
	If SupplierPartID does not uniquely identify the item, the supplier should use SupplierPartAuxiliaryID to specify an "auxiliary" 
	key that identifies the part uniquely when combined with the SupplierID and SupplierPartID. For example, a supplier might use 
	the same SupplierPartID for an item, but have a different price for units of "EA" and "BOX". In this case, a reasonable 
	SupplierPartAuxiliaryID for the two items might be "EA" and "BOX."
	
	SupplierPartAuxiliaryID could also be used as a supplier cookie, enabling the supplier to refer to complex configuration or 
	part data. It could contain all the data necessary for the supplier to reconstruct what the item in question is in their 
	computer system (a basket or cookie of data that makes sense only to the supplier).
	
	SupplierPartAuxiliaryID can help a remote website transport complex configuration or bill-of-goods information to re-identify 
	the item when it is presented to the remote website in the future.
	
	If SupplierPartAuxiliaryID contains special characters (for example, if it contains additional XML elements not defined in the 
	cXML protocol), they must be escaped properly. Due to the necessity to pass SupplierPartAuxiliaryID information through 
	applications and back to the originating supplier, an internal subset containing any additional XML elements is insufficient.

<!--
    Header of an order. This is the data that is sent to the supplier

    Total: If the Order is of type "blanket", the Total element is not used to compute
		the sum of the item level subtotals. The total is used to indicate the maximum
		commitment with the supplier. The total will not add up to the individual item
		level sub total or MaxAmounts. The item level MaxAmounts should not exceed the
		header level total. If the item level MaxAmount is not specified it is assumed
		that the Item level maximum amount is the same as the Total.

		the company code and purchasing organization, respectively.
	
    DeliveryPeriod: Start and end date for the delivery.
     	
    IdReference: ID reference is Within the application context (for example,
		a certain pair of buyer and supplier), the (identifier, domain) pair 
		should be unique.
 
	OrderRequestHeaderIndustry: Industry specific header information.

    DocumentReference: Only needed when the type is "update" or "delete". In that case, 
		the DocumentReference would reference the most recent OrderRequest document
		for the order. For example when an order is created, updated and then
		deleted, the final document should contain a DocumentReference
		referring to the OrderRequest with type="update". That document would,

    A Credential Message Authentication Code (MAC). This is used in
    situations where one party (the sender) must prove to another (the
    receiver) that it is authenticated by a shared secret with a third
    party trusted by both.

    The MAC should be computed by the trusted third party and
    transferred to the sender. The MAC should be opaque to the sender
    (that is, it should be secure and non-reversible). The MAC should
    use as its inputs enough information to accomplish the following
    goals:

    (1) The MAC must prove to the receiver that it really originated
    with the trusted third party. For example, the MAC could use a shared
    secret between the receiver and the trusted third party as its
    secret key.

    (2) The MAC should be usable only by a certain sender. For example, the
    MAC could authenticate an identifier for the sending organization.

    (3) The MAC should prove that the sender is authorized to send on
    behalf of the From organization. For example, the MAC could authenticate
    an identifier for the From organization.

    (4) The MAC should limit the risk of the MAC being compromised and
    used to impersonate the sender by another party communicating with
    the receiver. For example, the MAC could authenticate an expiration date
    or sequence number.

    LegalEntity: Legal entity defined in the external system. Smallest organizational unit of external accounting for which a complete,
        self-contained set of accounts can be created. This includes the entry of all transactions that must be posted and
        the creation of all items for legal individual financial statements, such as the balance sheet and the profit and loss statement.
        For example, Company Code for SAP.

    OrganizationalUnit: Purchase Unit or Purchase group defined in the external system.
        Purchase Unit is an organizational unit within Logistics. Almost all business transactions related to
        procurement are carried out in a purchase unit.
        A purchasing group corresponds to a buyer or group of buyers who perform the following
        purchasing activities:
		<ul>
		<li>Procuring certain articles or merchandise categories</li>
		<li>Acting as the contact for vendors</li>
		</ul>

		%

    ParentContractInfo: Parent contract Id if the current contract is a part of an hierarchy.

    FollowUpDocument: This would give a hint to the ERP system that the next step should be to create "value" Contract or "quantity" contract etc.
        Example 1: 
		%
		<FollowUpDocument type="value" category="Contract"/>
		%
        Example 2: 
		%
		<FollowUpDocument type="LP" category="Scheduling Agreement"/>
		%

    QuoteRequestReference: If the contract is referencing to QuoteRequest originated from the external system, send requestId and requestDate.

    TermsOfDelivery: Optional shipping terms (incoTerms) as defined by the International Chamber of
        Commerce. These terms inform the buyer which portion of the shipping charges are their responsibility.
        For example,
		%

        The lineNumber attribute in the <ItemIn> will be used to specify the corresponding
        lineNumber on the contract in the source buyer system.
        At an implementation, level checks should be made to validate this.

        itemClassification attribute in the <ItemIn> will be used to specify whether the current line item is material or service.

        The external system Id of PaymentTerm can be sent as an extrinsic inside of <PaymentTerm>
        For example,
		%
        <PaymentTerm payInNumberOfDays="30">
			<Extrinsic name="Id">Net30</Extrinsic>
        </PaymentTerm>
		%
        Address in ShipTo will be used specify Location (Plant or StorageLocation for SAP) of the line item.
        For example,
		% 
        <ShipTo>
			<Address
				addressID="3000"
				addressIDDomain="buyerLocationID"
				isoCountryCode="US">
				<Name xml:lang="en">Plant 3000</Name>
			</Address>
        </ShipTo>
		%

        <IdReference> in <ItemID> will be used to send the corresponding line number of the
        contract in the external system. For example, domain = "SAPLineNumber", identifier="0100"

        The quantity attribute in the ItemIn tag should be set to target quantity. If the line item is amount based,
        it could be set to one.

        The UnitsOfMeasure of Min/MaxQuantity and Min/MaxReleaseQuantity is same as the one in ItemDetail.

        The MaxReleaseAmount/Quantity and MinReleaseAmount/Quantity at an item level
        indicate the item level amounts and quantities per release (purchase order).

        <Modifications> in <UnitPrice> will be used to send Discount amount/percent, Surcharges, Tax, etc.
        For example,
		%
        <UnitPrice>
            <Money currency="USD">1000.00</Money>
            <Modifications>
                 <Modification>
                     <AdditionalDeduction type="DISCOUNT">
                         <DeductionAmount>
                             <Money currency="USD">10.00</Money>
                         </DeductionAmount>
                     </AdditionalDeduction>
                 </Modification>
            </Modifications>
        </UnitPrice>

    An AuthRequest is used when one party (the "receiver") receives
    credentials from another party (the "principal") and the receiver
    needs a trusted third party to validate the credentials.  The
    receiver should enclose the credentials in an AuthRequest and send
    them to the trusted third party for validation.

    If the principal attempts to authenticate by revealing the shared
    secret between itself and the trusted third party (not
    recommended), the receiver should forward the credentials as they
    were received, including the shared secret.

    If the principal attempts to authenticate through a client
    certificate (recommended), the receiver should forward the
    credentials as well as an X509Data element containing an
    X509IssuerSerial element describing the certificate used by the
    principal (the receiver normally obtains this information from its
    web server or SSL/TLS implementation).

    If the supplied credential is invalid, the trusted third party
    should respond with an empty cXML response of status 403
    (Forbidden).  If the supplied credential is valid, the trusted
    third party should respond with an AuthResponse that contains the
    valid credentials.

    @attr characteristicID Number of the characteristic. The combination of this attribute with operationNumber should be unique.

    @attr operationNumber Inspection operation. The combination of this attribute with characteristicID should be unique.

    @attr workCenter Work center number.

    @attr procedure A text value that specifies how the sample size is calculated and how the inspection characteristic is assigned values. 

    @attr isLocked Set to "yes" to indicate that a characteristic is locked and no further valuations are allowed.

    @attr allowDefectRecording Set to "yes" to indicate that defect recording is allowed. If an inspection characteristic is rejected 
		during results recording, the function for recording defects for a characteristic is automatically invoked.

    @attr characteristicType A buyer uses inspection characteristics to describe the inspection criteria for materials, parts, and 
		products. This allows the buyer to plan inspections systematically, uniformly, and economically. An inspection request can 
		contain different types of characteristics, some required, optional, or conditional. Specify one of the following values:
		<ul>
		<li>required - The inspection of this characteristic is required to create an inspection decision.</li>
		<li>optional - The inspection of this characteristic is not required to create an inspection decision.</li>
		<li>afterAccept - This conditional inspection characteristic must be inspected if the previous required characteristic was accepted.</li>
		<li>afterRejection - This conditional inspection characteristic must be inspected if the previous required characteristic was rejected.</li>
		</ul>

    @attr isQuantitative Set to "yes" if this characteristic uses a numerical measurement. Otherwise, the characteristic uses a non-numerical, 
		qualitative measurement.

    @attr recordingType Indicates how the valuation will be sent for this characteristic: 
        <ul>
		<li>singleResult - Single values for each inspection characteristic.</li>
		<li>summarizedRecording - Summarized values for each inspection characteristic.</li>
		<li>noCharacteristicRecording - No characteristic record.</li>
		<li>classedRecording - Classed values for each inspection characteristic.</li>
		</ul>

    @attr expirationDate Expiration date of the characteristic.

    @attr inspectionPoint Inspection point types for equipment, functional locations, physical samples, or production. These inspection 
		point types can be assigned individually in the user specifications, if required.

    @attr version Version of characteristic. If any of the attributes change for the characteristic, the ERP generates another version for it.

    @attr isAdHoc Indicates whether the characteristic does not exist in the reference document and is an additional valuation.

<!--
    The representation of a single component inventory, the product forecast details or a consignment movement for that product. 

    ItemID: A unique identification of a component item in supplier backend system or buyer backend system.

    ResourceID: A unique identification of a production facility leveraged during production, such as a piece of equipment or a production line.

    Description: Textual description of the component.

    Classification: Classification is used to group items into similar categories. This also includes product hierarchy and commodity information.
	
    SerialNumberInfo: This is a existing element. The representation of the required serial number information of a line item.
		Component Inventory will only accept only type="list" or type="range".

    ForecastDetails: Contains the cumulative start and end date of the forecast item.

    LeadTime: Lead time in days.

    PlannedAcceptanceDays: Number of days the buyer schedules for the inspection of goods after receiving them.

    ManufacturerPartID: ID with which the item's manufacturer identifies the item.
    
    ManufacturerName: Name of the item's manufacturer.

    ReferenceDocumentInfo: Contains details of referenced document.

    Characteristic: Characteristic contains detailed information about an item that can be used across different industries.
		Can also be used to send material characteristics to support configurable material process.

    Batch: Batch information of goods or material. The information includes ID and characteristics.

    Contact: The location from and to the product activity is taking place. The only Contact roles (Contact&#064;role attribute value) 
		likely to be sensible in this element are "locationFrom" and "locationTo". locationFrom can be used by the supplier system 
		to the determine the buyer notified ERP vendor ID or vendor location. locationTo can be used by the supplier system to 
		determine the location of the buyer where the product demand originates. To provide a plant location description, the 
		domain attribute of the element IdReference should be set to "buyerLocationID", "supplierLocationID" or "storageLocation" 
		and the identifier to the plantID.

    Inventory: Inventory that is in the possession of the buyer, and is owned and managed by the buyer.

    ConsignmentInventory: Inventory that is in the possession of the buyer, but is owned by the supplier.

    TimeSeries: Forecast data, can be of type "demand" or "orderForecast".

    InventoryTimeSeries: Support the transfer of projected stock, safety stock and target stock levels generated by the buyer's planning system 
		to facilitate supply or demand balance.

    ConsignmentMovement: The consignment movement information for this product.

    SalesReport: It contains all the information about the sales report at item level.

	UnitOfMeasure: The unit of measure for an inventory/forecast/consignment quantity at the Item level. This will be applicable for the entire item 
		and will be defaulted over the unit of measure maintained across the time series quantities.		

    PlanningTimeSeries: Planning information from buyers ERP system represented as keyfigures to provide visibility of critical business 
		information to suppliers and other partners.
